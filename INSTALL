WARNING: DON'T EVEN THINK OF ASKING VMWARE FOR HELP. YOU WON'T GET IT!

Application Description
=======================

The vMotion Detector is an application suite comprised of an C executable and
a Perl script based upon the VMware vSphere Guest SDK that allows a Windows
or Linux Guest VM detect when it has its Session ID modified due to an 
underlying DRS/HA clustered environment change. This application can be 
modified to work with Oracle OEM, Nagios or any other system monitoring 
applications.

REQUIRED:
---------
64-Bit C/C++ Compiler (GCC Compatible if possible)
VMware vSphere Guest SDK



Basic Installation
==================

Binary Version:
---------------
If you have a RHEL or CentOS 5.x platform, you can download the RPM binary,
which will automatically install a compiled version of the source and its
front-end trigger Perl script in the /usr/local/bin directory.

Source/Compile Version:
-----------------------
See "Compiling the Code" section below.



Alert Message Modifications (for those of you compiling the code)
===========================

The vMotion Detector code was originally designed for Oracle OEM 10g/11g
platform environments, using the needed em_result and em_message codes for
customizing the e-mail messages when alerted by the Oracle OEM platform.

If you wish to modify the code for other system monitoring platforms, such
as Nagios, the following lines will need to be modified for your result code
and, if needed, the alert message that goes along with it.

#ifdef OEM
		printf("em_result=0\nem_message=No vMotion activity detected.\n");
#endif

#ifdef OEM
		printf("em_result=1\nem_message=WARNING! vMotion detected!\n");
#endif



Compiling the Code
==================

Currently the compiling for the actual application is only available for the 
Linux platform. Future versions of the source code will be modified for
supporting Windows Server x64 platforms as well.

Compiling for Linux:
--------------------
gcc -g -o vmguestsessionid -ldl -I<path to VMware headers> vmGuestSessionId.c


Compiling for Windows Server x64:
---------------------------------
TBD


Application Installation
========================

The RHEL/CentOS 5.x RPM binary version of the application and its Perl front-end
script will automatically install to the /usr/local/bin directory.

The source code version will just create the "vmguestsessionid" executable in
the directory the code is compiled in. There is no Makefile or script for
copying the executable elsewhere. The default location for where the files
should be installed to is /usr/local/bin for Linux platforms.
